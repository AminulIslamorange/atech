Color choices and layout can communicate broad aspects of a businessâ€™s personality and style, but typography can communicate nuances in personality, industry, and style in a split second. While legibility should always be the priority in body text, feel free to experiment in headings with distinctive display fonts. For example, consider using an all-caps, handwriting, or graffiti font to represent an important theme, evoke a key era, or express the brand identity.</p>
